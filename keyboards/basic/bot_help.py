"""
The second command commonly invoked in a Telegram bot is the 'help' command.
Whenever you add a new command, ensure to include it here as well.

Maintain consistency: list commands here in the same sequence as in 'set_bot_commands.py',
begin every description with the same capitalization as previous commands,
and omit any punctuation if previous commands do not include it.

Remember, the 'help' command is crucial for every Telegram bot.
Make sure to update this documentation whenever you introduce a new command.
